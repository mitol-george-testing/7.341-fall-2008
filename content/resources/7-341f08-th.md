description: DNA repair. To cope with exposure to DNA-damaging agents, such as the
  sun's radiation or by-products of our normal metabolism, powerful DNA damage checkpoints
  have evolved. Once DNA damage checkpoints detect DNA lesions, cellular proliferation
  is stopped immediately and DNA repair is initiated. (Image courtesy of Tom Ellenberger,
